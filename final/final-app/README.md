# Overview:

Welcome to the Travel Initiative, created by Amber! My goal is to provide visitors with a platform that fulfills their every desire for the best travel spot around.

I used React to supply visitors with an uninterrupted internet experience, preventing annoying page reloads while delivering a seamless platform. React fetches data handled by Express back end. A visitor has to login first and she/he will have their personal page which shows the user information. This website also allows a visitor to provide information on travel spots! Once logged in, a visitor just needs to open the travel spot form to have their desired travel spots displayed on the main page! On each travel spot card, the "details' link will lead the user to each travel spot page. This page shows more information about the travel spot including image and introduction. Once more travel spot are posted, the user can choose their favorite spots by clicking checkbox on the travel spot card and the favorite travel spot list will be provided. The user can have access to the favorite list by clicking Favorite travel spots on the nav bar.
